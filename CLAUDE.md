- N/A (hooks process files in-place, no persistent storage needed) (002-style-maintainability-hooks)

- Python 3.8+ (minimum version compatible with most development environments; pre-commit supports Python 3.8+) + None (Python standard library only per FR-012 and Constitution I - KISS principle) (001-pre-commit-hooks)
